## Missing letters 

[https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/missing-letters](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/missing-letters)

Find the missing letter in the passed letter range and return it.

If all letters are present in the range, return undefined.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

Here are some helpful links:

* String.prototype.charCodeAt()
* String.fromCharCode()

### Results:
1. `fearNotLetter("abce”)` should return "d".
2. `fearNotLetter("abcdefghjklmno”)` should return "i".
3. `fearNotLetter("bcd”)` should return undefined.
4. `fearNotLetter("yz”)` should return undefined.
