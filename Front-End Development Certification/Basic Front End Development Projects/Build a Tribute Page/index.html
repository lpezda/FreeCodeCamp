    <h4>Early Years</h4>
<p>In 1812 Malinowski’s father, Jacob, fought for Napoleon during the Russian campaign. Ernest, one of Jacob’s four children, was born six years after this in the Russian partition of Poland. In 1830 Jacob Malinowski chose once again to fight against the Tsars - he joined the November Uprising, a Polish rebellion against Russian rule. After the uprising was defeated, he had to leave partitioned Poland. He went to Dresden with his son, Ernest’s brother Rudolf;  Ernest soon joined them there. The family eventually went to France where they settled, and Ernest would never move back to his fatherland. The November Uprising would come to play an important part in Malinowski’s life; had it not been for his father’s participation in the rebellion, he might never have come to Peru.</p>
 <p>In France Ernest Malinowski studied at the prestigious National School of Roads and Bridges. After graduating in 1838 and started to work as an engineer on building railroads near Paris. Later he went to Algeria where he worked on building roads and ports. After returning to France he participated in many engineering projects there until 1852. That year he moved to Peru where, according to a six-year contract he signed, he was to build roads, bridges, and provide technical education.</p>

<h4>National Hero</h4>
<p>He ended up doing far more than that and stayed much longer than planned. In Peru, apart from opening a technical school and building railroads, he helped carry out monetary reform, worked on the rebuilding of the war-devastated town of Arequipa, and, last but not least, saved the country from the Spaniards by winning the battle of the port of Callao.</p>
<p>It was the 2nd of May 1866 when Ernest Malinowski stood on an embankment of the Santa Rosa fort in Peru’s Pacific Port of Callao, commanding the artillery units that were firing at the mighty Spanish war fleet which had sailed to South America on a mission to recapture Spain’s former colonies on that continent. Malinowski knew exactly what he was doing because he had designed the fortifications of this port himself and prepared its defence. Before the battle he ordered a number of cannons to be camouflaged and mounted on mobile platforms. When the Spanish ships came close to the port they were hit by artillery fire that the crews never expected. All of the invading vessels were damaged, and Peru and its South American allies won a great victory.</p>
<p>Ernest Malinowski was the architect of this triumph. For defeating the Spanish he was given honorary citizenship of Peru and the title of national hero for the country. After that victory, Malinowski became famous in Peru, but the 1866 triumph wasn’t the last great feat Malinowski performed for the country.</p>
