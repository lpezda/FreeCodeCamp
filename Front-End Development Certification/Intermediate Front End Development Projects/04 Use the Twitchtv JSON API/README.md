# FreeCodeCamp
## Use the Twitchtv JSON API 

[https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api)

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: [https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/).

2. **Rule #1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

3. **Rule #2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

4. **User Story**: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

5. **User Story**: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

6. **User Story**: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

7. **User Story**: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.

8. **Hint**: See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at [https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Front-End-Project-Use-Twitchtv-JSON-API](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Front-End-Project-Use-Twitchtv-JSON-API).

9. **Hint**: The relevant documentation about this API call is here: [https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/v3_resources/streams.md#get-streamschannel](https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/v3_resources/streams.md#get-streamschannel).

10. **Hint**: Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: `[„ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas”]`

11. Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

12. When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

13. You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.

### A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at [http://codepen.io/lukaszpezda/pen/akQEWP](http://codepen.io/lukaszpezda/pen/akQEWP).
