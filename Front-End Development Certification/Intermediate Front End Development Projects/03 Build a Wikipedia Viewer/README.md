1. **Objective**: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/.

2. **Rule #1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

3. **Rule #2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

4. **User Story**: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

5. **User Story**: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

6. **Hint #1**: Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random).

7. **Hint #2**: Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page).

8. **Hint #3**: Use this link to experiment with Wikipedia's API.

9. Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

10. When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

11. You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
