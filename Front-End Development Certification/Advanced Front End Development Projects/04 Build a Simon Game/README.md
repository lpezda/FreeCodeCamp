## Build a Simon Game

[https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-simon-game](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-simon-game)


1. **Objective**: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: [https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/obYBjE](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/obYBjE).

1. **Rule #1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

1. **Rule #2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

1. **User Story**: I am presented with a random series of button presses.

1. **User Story**: Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.

1. **User Story**: I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.

1. **User Story**: If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.

1. **User Story**: I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.

1. **User Story**: If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.

1. **User Story**: I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.

1. **User Story**: I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.

1. **Hint**: Here are mp3s you can use for each button:

1. Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

1. When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

1. You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
